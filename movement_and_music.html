        <h2>The Importance of Music and Movement in Child Development</h2>
        <p>
          Engaging children in music and movement activities helps to develop
          their motor skills, enhances their understanding of rhythm and
          patterns, and supports their social and emotional growth. Music and
          movement also provide a joyful way for children to express their
          creativity and connect with others.
